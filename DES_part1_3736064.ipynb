    "To be sure/confident about our results, the simulation can be run over and over again and some statistical paramters such as _mean number of dropped packets_, _variance of dropped packets_ can be calculated. \n",

    "For example if the _no. of packets dropped_ in simulation is close to the mean value of dropped packets obtained over a 1000 simulations, we know the no. of dropped packets are correct and hence obtain confidence. This phenomenon is also stated by law of large number in probibility theory.\n",

    "**Reference:** In probability theory, the law of large numbers (LLN) is a theorem that describes the result of performing the same experiment a large number of times. According to the law, the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value and will tend to become closer to the expected value as more trials are performed.(source: Wikepedia)"

    "Heap is better for implementation of a **priority queue** because of the fact that the root of the heap always has either the minimum value(_**min heap**--our case_) or the maximum value(_**max heap**_) in the heap. This makes things like popping and pushing items in the queue quite easy and error free.\n",
