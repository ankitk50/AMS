    "\n",
    "If we implement the event chain at the beginning, then we will have a predefined series of execution of events.But it might happen a packet's service time is much less than the interarrival time of two customers.In this case a Service Completion event needs to be inserted in the event chain before the next customer arrival event comes into the event chain.This can reduce  the overall execution time of the simulation and hence improve the efficiency of the simulator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we can also take the reverse case to be true.Suppose serving a particular packet is taking too long for the server and the time taken is bigger than the interarrival time of the customers.In that case,the service completion event keeps on running and the Customer arrival event (next service completion event cant run because one packet is currently being served in the server) is blocked.So, now we can change the system so that the Customer arrival event comes in while the other packet is being served by the server.This will help in reducing simulation time and hence improve efficiency."
